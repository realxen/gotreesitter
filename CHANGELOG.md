# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
for tags and release notes while still in `0.x`.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Swift external scanner with full lexical support: all 33 external tokens, operator disambiguation, raw strings with interpolation, block comments, semicolon insertion, and compiler directives.
- File extension registration for 48 languages.
- Pooled file parsing to reduce parser allocations.
- Token source state snapshot/restore for incremental leaf fast path.

### Changed
- Swift grammar source switched from abandoned `tree-sitter/tree-sitter-swift` to actively maintained `alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift`.
- External scanner count increased from 112 to 116.
- All 206 grammars now produce error-free parse trees (previously 3 degraded).

### Fixed
- Swift C parity: lock file updated to match the grammar used for blob generation.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Incremental parsing engine: fast path for token-invariant leaf edits, top-level node reuse after edits, dirty-flag clearing along modified path only, and external scanner checkpoints for incremental reuse.
- Adaptive arena sizing and GSS capacity hinting for incremental and full parses.
- Parser timeout and cancellation support (`WithTimeout`, `WithCancellation`).
- Parser pool for concurrent parse workloads.
- Arena memory budget to prevent OOM crashes.
- Linguist-style language detection: filename, extension, and interpreter/shebang-based detection with display names (`cmd/gen_linguist`, `grammars/linguist_*.go`).
- Syntax highlighting queries for 40+ additional languages including top-50 grammars, norg, promql, and tmux.
- Native TOML lexer with date/time parsing.
- GLR-aware C preprocessor lexer with function-like macros, signed literals, and synthetic endif.
- Query metadata accessors for captures, strings, and pattern ranges.
- Query match limits, depth bounds, and symbol alias support.
- `Tree.Copy`, `Parser.Language`, `Node.Edit`, and `RootNodeWithOffset` API additions.
- Parser logging and tree DOT visualization for debugging.
- Multi-strategy full parse retry with bounded escalation.
- Dense token lookup for small parser states.
- Real-world corpus parity board and reporter (`cgo_harness`).
- GLR canary set and cap-pressure tests for parity regression detection.
- CI grammar freshness validation, tiered benchmark baselines, and coverage ratchet.

### Changed
- Structural language parity coverage expanded from 54 to 100 curated languages.
- Parser reduce hot path optimized: scratch buffers, pre-computed alias sequences, fast visible reduce path, deferred hidden node flattening to visible parent boundary.
- GLR engine tuned: lazy GSS node hashing in single-stack mode, key-based stack culling, small-path merge optimization, temporary stack oversubscription before culling.
- Query engine optimized: dense array for root pattern lookup, compile-time alternation matching index, avoid heap allocation for candidate indices.
- Go and TypeScript normalization refactored to symbol-based context; span attribution switched on language.

### Fixed
- Top-50 parity burndown: broad fixes across lexers, normalization, scanners, and GLR paths reducing degraded grammars to 0.
- GLR robustness: deterministic stack culling, correct tie-breaking for duplicate stacks, all-dead stack recovery, preferred visible tokens in union DFA on exact ties, higher action specificity on same lexeme.
- External scanner fixes: correct MarkEnd ordering, retry with state validation table, deterministic external-scanner mode for parity.
- Field attribution: prevent inherited field misassignment across GLR branches, correct field assignment for C# join clauses, skip inherited field projection when target span has direct fields.
- Span calculation: correct span for invisible nodes in GLR reduce, chain hidden spans via backward scan, extend parent span to window with predecessor boundary clamping.
- Query fixes: handle repeated field names with sibling capture accumulation, multi-sibling grouping patterns with wildcard root.
- Zero-width token handling to match C tree-sitter semantics.
- Byte offset-based UTF-8 column tracking in lexer.
- Infinite missing-token recovery cycles prevented.
- Conflicting inherited field IDs in `buildFieldIDs` resolved.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `ParseWith` functional options API (`WithOldTree`, `WithTokenSource`, `WithProfiling`) and `ParseResult`.
- Parser runtime diagnostics surfaced on `Tree` (`ParseRuntime`, stop-reason/truncation metadata).
- Top-50 grammar smoke correctness gate and expanded cgo parity suites (fresh parse, no-error corpus checks, issue repros, GLR canary).
- Grammar lock update automation (`cmd/grammar_updater` + CI workflow integration).
- Configurable injection parser nesting depth.

### Changed
- Full-parse GLR behavior tuned for correctness-first performance:
  - lower default global GLR stack cap with better top-K retention behavior,
  - improved merge/pruning hot paths and profiling counters,
  - benchmark harness tightened to avoid truncated-parse results.
- Significant parser/query maintainability refactors:
  - parser/query monoliths split into focused files (`parser_*`, `query_compile_*`).
- README benchmark and gate documentation refreshed to match current numbers and commands.

### Fixed
- Multiple parity/correctness regressions in HTML/YAML/disassembly paths and grammar support wiring.
- Query predicate parsing and generated query edge cases.
- Rewriter multi-edit coordinate handling and parser profile availability signaling.
